Is a websearch API sufficient for webscraping financial data? Is an LLM with search capabilities sufficient for webscraping financial data?

Used python script to test various websearch APIs to determine if any are sufficient for webscraping financial data.

Due to LLM API payment requirements, used unpayed LLM search capabilites to determine if any are sufficient for webscraping financial data.
