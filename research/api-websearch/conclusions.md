Websearch APIs sufficiently aggregate articles for further webscraping. Payed options allow for webscraping included with websearch though these payed versions were not explored in this experiment.

LLM websearches provide good sources for further analysis and their responses are short summaries of the various cited articles.

Use of an LLM with search capabilites is effective. This should be compared to effectiveness of Selenium or equivalent API/module.
