# ThoughtNode

**Personalized AI-Synthesized Insights, Delivered Straight to Your Inbox**

ThoughtNode is a lightweight, open-source Python package that delivers curated, AI-generated insight streams‚Äîcalled *ThoughtNodes*‚Äîbased on real-time web data. It‚Äôs built for Django-based systems but can also run standalone, helping users stay informed without needing to constantly monitor sources themselves, or subscribe to general news digests.
